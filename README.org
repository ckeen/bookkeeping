Bookkeeping - A simple couchapp to take care of your expenses

* Introduction
  bookkeeping is a small couchapp that I wrote to visualise my
  expenses for my small household. It allows you to enter expenses and
  put them into freely defineable categories. A daily and a monthly
  tab summarise what you have spend so far.

  Thanks to tuftegraph you will see nice stacked graphs showing how
  much money you spent each month to which category.

* Prerequesites
  As bookkeeping is a couchapp you will need the [[http://github.com/couchapp/couchapp][couchapp]] program
  itself and also couchdb in a recent version. (I started with 0.10.x
  so anything like this will work)

* Used software libraries
  I am standing on shoulders of giants here. This little app includes:
  - [[jqueryui.com][jqueryui]]
  - [[http://github.com/xaviershay/tufte-graph][tufte-graph]] by Xavier Shay

* Installation
  This is pretty straight forward. As it is a couchapp like many others a simple 
  chouchapp push . http://youruser:yourpass@localhost:5984/dbname
  will do.

* Current flaws / Todo list
  - No user authentication is currently enforced so everyone can edit anything!
  - Just add categories as you go, the app will add them.
  - No meta editing implemented such as renaming of categories. Use futon for now.
